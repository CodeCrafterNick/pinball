# Pinball Locations Mapper

## Overview
Using Javascript, I leveraged the pinballmap API to find the nearest pinball locations.

## Requirements Completed
- Use the https://pinballmap.com/api/v1/docs API.
- The user should be able to both enter their latitude and longitude and autofill their latitude and longitude fields by clicking a Near Me button.
- When the user clicks the Search button, a list of the closest pinball locations appear on the page.
